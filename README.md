# 100DaysofPython
This is a collection of completed lessons from the Udemy course called 
"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" by Dr. Angela Yu. 

I started doing this with a Windows OS but later, switched over to a linux distro, Manjaro to complete with either PyCharm or VS Code IDE.
